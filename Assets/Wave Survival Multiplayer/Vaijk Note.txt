1. Be very carefull when renaming GameObjects in the Scene, since many scripts search for GameObjects based on its name;
2. Be very carefull when renaming tags and changing GameObject tags, since many scripts search for GameObjects based on its tag;
3. If something is not working as expected, try reading on the script specific to that GameObject/action, I've put in a few
guidelines on scripts that were relevant to them;
